During this year (January to September), we are constantly reducing the error rates for OpenShot Video Editor. Of course, our goals are 0% accidents, but we still have the way to go.

To be involved, please email me, and I will help you build everything, and hopefully guide you to the right direction to deal with one of these insects. I'll help you, so nothing to be afraid.
